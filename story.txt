	This is a story about a man named Wilbert. One day, Wilbert decided to find the toolbox he used to use when he was a carpenter. He said to himself, "It reminds me of the good old days, but what happened to me now? It has been twenty years already." Making sure he is not disturbing Pepper, his pet parrot, he slowly took his steps into his basement downstairs.
	Unfortunatly, Pepper the parrot died two days later. The reason for his death is unknown but many speculate Wilber's unsafe use of his toolbox contributed to Pepper's death. Wilbert decided that he will get a new pet. He bought a cat from a sketchy website online and named it "Cat". 

Then he was hit by a truck and reincarnated into another world.
